# Fracjure

A fractal drawing program with mouse gesture navigation controls similar to
Apple Maps for Mac.

## Setup

Clone, setup JavaFX, and run `lein run`

How to set up JavaFX, I'm not exactly sure.  I did this a while ago.  I believe
I used these instructions: https://coderwall.com/p/4yjy1a and be sure to use the
name and version that I used in the project file or update the project file with
the ones you used.
